##   Project MoQoS
The code was enhanced during the project MoQoS in 2017 - 2018. The project aimed to facilitate cooperation among national telecommunication regulators across Europe by creating, publishing and reusing open data related to broadband Internet.

The project established a cross-border platform for crowd-sourcing data related to the quality of service of the high-speed Internet, both mobile broadband and fixed-lines. 

These apps are operated directly by national telecommunication regulators from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia. This data can be used for comparison of various mobile network operators and ISPs, as well as for other analyses, e.g. indicating meeting (or not meeting) the broadband coverage obligations in rural areas. 

In total, more than 300.000 measurements in the four participating countries were performed during the project. This data is available on the respective country data portals and on the central EU data portal.

The platform also contains visualization of aggregated data allowing end users an easy check of the quality of coverage at a given place.

The project MoQoS was co-financed by the Connecting Europe Facility of the European Union (CEF).
